Development: Use the JDK to write, compile, and debug Java code.    javac HelloWorld.java
Deployment: Use the JRE to run Java applications on end-user machines.java HelloWorld
Execution: The JVM, part of both JRE and JDK, actually runs the Java program.

=> Dynamic class loading: 
Class.forName(String className)
ClassLoader.loadClass(String name)

classpath:jvm needs it to get class location

multiple inheitance not supported for class but why for interface 
overload vs overrid e
operator overload not supported in java 
why return type overloading is not supported 
overload main method ,
No, a static method cannot be overridden in Java
### covariant return type specifies that the return type may vary in the same direction as the subclass
###the covariant return type is implemented by allowing a subclass method to return a subtype of the superclass method's return type. 
super vs this===immediate parent vs current_instance in use 
final vs finalize vs finally
polymorphism ::: single task in different ways !!!
                >>> multiple method/implementation ::::-method overload >>>compile time??early binds --static binding

Object class!!!
The Object class provides several methods :::
toString() method:obj to string formated
hashCode() method
equals(Object obj) method
finalize() method
getClass() method
clone() method
wait(), notify() notifyAll() (Concurrency methods)


what is hashcode()::::
A common misconception about this method is that the hashCode() method returns the address of the object, which is not correct.
It converts the internal address of the object to an integer by using an algorithm.

cloning vs copying :::
class Student implements Cloneable {

    // other components

    public Student clone()
        throws CloneNotSupportedException
    {

        // call Object.clone()
        Student obj = (Student)super.clone();

        // clone mutable fields
        obj.birthDay = (Date)birthDay.clone();
    }

Java provides a java.util.concurrent.

and supports future and/or periodic execution of tasks/threads.

2. Executorservice--->threadpoolexecutor(that creates the thread before hand )
uneed to just call runnable when cpu is read for load acceptance .? design 2 what is good n poor points?

Daemon vs main thread vs user thread

1. JVM uruns gc , daemon , signal dispatcher , JIT first go
2. main thread then main() is executed
..... till the main ifnisheas its last line JVM runs , n all user threads too 
....if now main is finished ...only daemon remains , daemon thread get them self stop

3. A shudden stoppage :::
on system.exit() trigger then shutdownhook is called at runtime termination occures
before jvm stops the system or a specific thread can be cutoff 

4. each thread after its run() code got executed is demanded for garbage collection 

thread synchronisation: synchronized block ,

=======================================================
serialization::: 
objects are nested or complexed format , so it is converted to linear , byte-based format 
that is stream 
why cNannot we store java objects directly ?
Java objects in memory:

Have references, pointers, metadata, and object headers that are JVM-specific
May reference other objects (deep nesting, circular references)
Aren’t in a flat or portable format
So if we try to store an object directly in memory or DB:
You’d lose the structure or data

How does HashMap work internally in Java?
HashMap stores key-value pairs.
Uses hashCode() to compute index (bucket).

In case of collisions, it uses a LinkedList or Tree (since Java 8) to store multiple entries in the same bucket.

Uses equals() to compare keys in the same bucket.

🧪 Example:
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("name", "Ranjit");
map.put("name", "Appukutti"); // Overwrites previous value
🧩 Output: Final value for "name" is "Appukutti".

✅ 2. What is the difference between == and .equals() in Java?
🧠 Key Concept: Object comparison

🛠️ Explanation:

== checks reference equality (memory address).

.equals() checks logical equality (value).

String a = new String("Java");
String b = new String("Java");

System.out.println(a == b); // false
System.out.println(a.equals(b)); // true
✅ Use .equals() for comparing object contents.

✅ 3. Write a program to reverse a string without using built-in functions.
🧠 Key Concept: String manipulation

public class ReverseString {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String input = "Tec Skool";
 String reversed = "";
 for (int i = input.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
 reversed += input.charAt(i);
 }
 System.out.println("Reversed: " + reversed);
 }
}
💡 Tip: Use StringBuilder for better performance in real-world apps.

✅ 4. Explain the difference between LinkedList and ArrayList
ArrayList Example
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListExample {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
 list.add("Apple");
 list.add("Banana");
 list.add("Orange");

 System.out.println("Element at index 1: " + list.get(1)); // Fast read
 }
}

✅ LinkedList Example
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class LinkedListExample {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<>();
 list.add("Dog");
 list.add("Cat");
 list.addFirst("Rabbit"); // Fast insert at beginning

 System.out.println("First Element: " + list.getFirst());
 }
}
These examples show:
ArrayList is best when you read by index.
LinkedList is useful when you add/remove items frequently, especially at the start or end

✅ 5. What is the difference between final and finally?
final int a = 10; // value cannot be changed.
finally — Block that always executes after try-catch.

try {
 // risky code
} finally {
 // clean-up
}
