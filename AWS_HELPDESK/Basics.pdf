EC2 ? IAAS 
TYPES OF STORAGE IN EC2?VOLUME N INSTANCE STORAGE 
STATE OF EC2 INSTANCE ? create ,pending, lauch,running,stopped(disk),terminated 
How to create a ec2 instace ?
instance id 
instance name 
os setting
network setting ---port 22 ssh 
security grps auth http https 
rout ebased config 

that will create access key n access secreat code . 

> by default EC2 is private 
> to access the ppublic api , network use internet gateway config 

Types of EC instance ?
spot instance 
t2.micro2 
t2.micro1 
c5 
c6g

0.0.0.0/0 ? what type of IP it is ?
(all IP address are open for communication to EC2 instance )

AWS lambda vs ec2 ?
ec2==> virtual machine creation 
lambda ==> code run on event propoagrtte n is config to storage 
            per api hit , time taken in req-response lifecycle 





what is AWS AMI 
> Amazon machine image 
> AMI comes with permission , root valume , block device mapping 

AWS console vs AWS CLI ?



AWS cloudwatch ?
> launch EC2 instance , monitoring_ENABLED 
> manage and monitor the operational data .
> metric , cloudwatch log , cloudwatch event , cloudwatch bridge 
> create a schedule in cloud watch to take snapshop , and introduce versioning in datastore 
>Alarm system OK/ALARM -->SNS notification , create ALAMRS 


>AWS RDS vs AWS DynamoDB vs AWS Athena?
>in RDS in security grp communication must be open for port 3306 .
>Athena is the datastorer u can query the athena for fetching data .

create s3 bucket with private access , uploat the frontend zip ,unzip n run 
use AWS cloudfront -->for fast access and config with s3 bucket to access bucket data 
in s3 alter the policy and add cloudfront config 
buy a domain and url for website from hostinger or other platform , use route r5  to configure public vpc 
add url to AWS route r5 and run the application 
----->
for backend aspect 
create dynamo db to create table or schema code key-value 
now create IAM user that can access dynamo db full access through lambda func call 
create lambda func 
attach IAM to specified lambda func 
write lambda code n deploy n test 
use curl lambda_url to test in web 
now reformat frontend code n upload on s3 bucket with lambda url integrated 


Elastic Block STORAGE ? 
VOLUME 
snapshot 

public Ip , private Ip , elastic Ip ?

***elastic Ip is charged !!!

EC2, ECS , EFS 



AWS Beanstack 


==============================================================================


You have been assigned to design a VPC architecture for
a 2-tier application. The application needs to be highly available and scalable.
How would you design the VPC architecture?


VPC contain various subnet grps 
1. public subnet grp :: load balancer --->incoming internet traffic 
2. private subnet  grp::: application server API---> loadbalancer 



Question 2: Your organization has a VPC with multiple subnets. 
You want to restrict outbound internet access for resources in one 
subnet, but allow outbound internet a
access for resources in another subnet. How would you achieve this?

routing table alteration go on route setting 
remove 0.0.0.0/0 Ip and add ur ip list or internet gateway  



 You have a VPC with a public subnet and a private subnet. 
 instances in the private subnet need to access the internet for software updates. 
 How would you allow internet access for instances in the private subnet?

 NAT gateawy creation in public subnet 
 route all outbound request to NAT gateway 




 : You have launched EC2 instances in your VPC,
  and you want them to communicate with each other using
   private IP addresses. What steps would you take to enable this communication?

   instances must be in same VPC 
   instances must be in same subnet grp bound 



NACL ?
inbound and outbound rules can be defined here 

NACL vs security groups ?




:You have a private subnet in your VPC that contains a number of instances that should not have direct internet access. However, you still need to be able to securely access these instances for administrative purposes.
 How would you set up a bastion host to facilitate this access?

 create a bastion host server EC2 in public subnet 
 inbound n outbound ip to 
 trusted IP addresses .



web app host req: high available 

Take EC2 instance , deploy ur code in EC2 
use load balancer , auto-scale 
static file in cloudfront n s3 
else on DynamoDB 


EC2 instance troblule shoot not working ?

Ec2 instance current status check 
Ec2 instance security grp check 
Ec2 instance network restrictions  .
see the logs n alarm of cloudwatch metric check  . 
see the role policy , grp ploicy etx .
else replace the ec2 create snp n replace .



How to replace the preexisting bad EC2 with new ?
create a snapshot of EC2 volume 
create a new EBS using snapshot 
make a new ec2 instance attach this ebs to ec2 new instance . 


read heavy use--->RDS 
write heavy -->use Dynamo db , AFS 


secure communication::: private subnet , NACL rule - policy , AWS kms
